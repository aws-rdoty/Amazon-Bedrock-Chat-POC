        Answer:  According to Adobe's licensing policies, an end user can install and activate Adobe TLP (Transactional Licensing Program) or CLP (Cumulative Licensing Program) software on up to two computers. Some key points on Adobe's TLP/CLP licensing:

- The two activations can be on either Mac or Windows computers.

- The computers must be owned by the individual license holder or their organization. 

- The software can only be used by the individual license holder. It cannot be shared or transferred to someone else.

- If the license holder wants to activate the software on a new computer, they first need to deactivate it on one of the existing computers.

- Adobe allows reactivating the software once every 99 days if there are no activations left.

- For perpetual licenses, the software can be used indefinitely. For subscription licenses, the software will stop working when the subscription ends.

- Licensing is tied to the specific version of the software. Upgrades to newer versions require a paid upgrade or move to a subscription.

So in summary, yes end users can install and activate TLP/CLP Adobe software on up to 2 computers they own and use, with the ability to periodically reactivate on new devices if needed. The software cannot be shared and is tied to the individual license holder.
        
        Question: what was the score of the jets game last weekend?
        
        Answer:  I'm afraid I don't have enough context to determine which Jets game you are asking about. There are a few different professional sports teams that use the name "Jets":

- The New York Jets - An NFL (American football) team.

- The Winnipeg Jets - An NHL (ice hockey) team. 

- The New York Jets and Winnipeg Jets both have multiple affiliated teams across different leagues as well.

To help me provide a more useful answer, please provide additional context such as:

- The full team name (e.g. New York Jets)

- The sport (e.g. NFL football) 

- The opponent they played against

- The approximate date or day of the week of the game

With those extra details I should be able to look up the score you are asking about. Please let me know if you can provide any of that supplemental information!
        
        Question: what was the score of the new york jets game last weekend?
        
        Answer:  Unfortunately I do not have enough information to definitively determine the score of the New York Jets game last weekend. The NFL regular season has ended and the Jets did not make the playoffs, so they did not play a game this past weekend. 

The last game the New York Jets played was on January 8th, 2023 when they lost to the Miami Dolphins 11-6 to end their regular season with a 7-10 record. 

If you were asking about a different New York Jets game from earlier in their season, please provide more details like the opponent they played, the exact or approximate date, or if it was a regular season or playoff game. With more context I can search and find the final score you are looking for. Let me know if you can provide any additional details!
