        Answer:  Here is a sample Lucene query:

```
title:"The Lord of the Rings" AND text:Frodo AND text:Gandalf
```

This query would search for documents that contain the words "The Lord of the Rings" in the title field, as well as contain the words "Frodo" and "Gandalf" anywhere in the text of the document.

Some key things about Lucene queries:

- Fields like "title" and "text" can be specified to search only in certain parts of the documents.

- AND, OR, NOT logical operators can be used to construct more complex queries.

- Phrase queries like "The Lord of the Rings" search for an exact sequence of terms.

- Special characters like +, -, *, ?, etc can be used for things like boosting terms or fuzzy matching.

- Lucene supports range queries on numeric fields like dates.

- Query syntax can get quite complex with combinations of fields, operators, parentheses, etc.

So in summary, Lucene provides a very rich query language for text search across documents. This sample query demonstrates some basic syntax and capabilities.
